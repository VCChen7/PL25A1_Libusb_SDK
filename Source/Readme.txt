    This software package includes the following components:
    1. listdev
        A sample program to list PL25A1 device and show its information
    2. transmit
        A simplified program to transmit data from sender to receiver
    3. data_transfer_example
        A sample program to transfer data through two PL25A1 USB devices
    
Test/Build Environment
    Ubuntu 14.04 x64 and Ubuntu 16.04 x64

Installation/Build
    Follow the below steps to install the latest libusb and build all sample programs:
    1. Install all necessary packages – libudev-dev
        a. Download the latest package lists from the repositories by typing “sudo apt-get update” in the command line
        b. Install “libudev-dev” by typing “sudo apt-get install libudev-dev” in the command line
    2. Build and install the libusb
 packed in the SDK
        a. Extract libusb-1.0.20.tar.bz2 to the directory “libusb”
        b. Change directory to “libusb”
        c. Run “./configure”
 to configure the build environment
        d. Run “make” to build the library
        e. Run “sudo make install” to install it
 on the system
    3. Build the sample programs
        a. Change directory to “PL25A1 for Linux”
        b. Run “make” to build all programs, and then “listdev”, “transmit”, and “data_transfer_example” will be created
    
Execution
listdev
    Perform the below steps to run the sample program “listdev”:
    1. Connect both sides of PL25A1 USB cable to two PCs running Ubuntu OS.
    2. On any Ubuntu system, execute the following command
        sudo ./listdev
    After that, the program lists found PL25A1 device and show its information.
transmit
    Perform the below steps to run the sample program “transmit”:
    1. Connect both sides of PL25A1 USB cable to two PCs running Ubuntu OS. One is called Ubuntu A, and another is called Ubuntu B.
    2. On Ubuntu A, execute the following command
        sudo ./transmit recv
    3. On Ubuntu B, execute the following command
        sudo ./transmit send
    After that, the sender program transmit data to the receiver program.
data_transfer_example
    Perform the below steps to run the sample program “data_transfer_example”:
    1. Connect both sides of PL25A1 USB cable to two PCs running Ubuntu OS. One is called Ubuntu A, and another is called Ubuntu B.
    2. On Ubuntu A, execute the following command
        sudo ./data_transfer_example recv
    3. On Ubuntu B, execute the following command
        sudo ./data_transfer_example send
    After that, the sender program transmit data to the receiver program.
